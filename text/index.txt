My name's Ken Pederson. I come from a military background having retired from the Missouri Air National Guard after 21 years of service. Briefly before retiring, I discovered the Veteran's Affairs program, VET TEC, which has provided me the opportunity to attend a pre-approved coding bootcamp to pursue my dream of becoming a software engineer. My intent is to capture my journey on this site so that like-minded veterans and aspiring software engineers may learn from my mistakes and successes .
